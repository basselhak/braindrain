    "# The intra-EU politics of brain drain - NetworkX analysis\n",

    "The purpose of this analysis is to explore a hand-coded set of Parliamentary Questions posed in the European Parliament concerning the topic of 'brain drain' as an intra-European Union phenomenon. The topic has become increasingly controversial in recent years with the growing politicization of the negative externalities of European labor mobility. \n",
